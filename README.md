==========================

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio-contrib/solidus_expedited_exchanges.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio-contrib/solidus_expedited_exchanges)

Expedited shipping provides a "cross shipping" feature for returns. It was extracted from Solidus for version 2.2.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_expedited_exchanges to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_expedited_exchanges'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_expedited_exchanges:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
